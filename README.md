# Nearest-K-Neighbors Implementation
Implemented in Python using Tensorflow, Numpy, SKLearn and other appropriate libraries. A classic machine learning project.

# Intuition behind the algorithm
In a given data plot for classification machine learning problems, one thing we can try to do is to find a point that has K number of data points nearby. This algorithm works by looking at the nearest neighbors of a point to determine its class. The basis of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is the so-called euclidean distance, which looks very similar to the Pythagorean Theorem.
